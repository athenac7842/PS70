    <p> This week we used a breadboard to create a simple circuit to light an LED bulb.</p>

        I never used this kind of breadboard. I think it was super interesting that it could be connected to the computer and be told to act in certain ways.
        Although I did not personally get this to work right away in class, the ability to design how complicated (by adding more wires) or how simple to create the circuit
        was really cool. I also found it very helpful to see the breadboard with the inside exposed to visually understand how it is connecting the nodes.
