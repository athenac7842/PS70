        I decided to use the capacitors as a creator of random noise. The project outcome was very entertaining and I was able to study the distances that created different noises. There is a switch to allow it to be turned on and off.

        You will need: <br></br> <br></br> <br></br> <img src="assets/images/week6/IMG_1727.JPG" width="50%" style="transform:rotate(90deg)"/> <br></br> <br></br> <br></br> - a tone generator. Here I use the vertical strips of the breadboard since it is easier to plug in the tone and make sure the pins are not on the same strip. <br></br> <br></br> <br></br> <img src="assets/images/week6/IMG_1724.JPG" width="50%" style="transform:rotate(90deg)"/> <br></br> <br></br> <br></br>- two copper sheets on paper attached to respectice wire.
        <br></br> - and a switch.

        I am using Rob's microcontroller. This controller worked better than the Adafruit one, and did not require me to download the driver for Metro (which I was having difficulty with) for capactive touch). I did have to install the MattairTech board pack for Arduino and select the Generic D11C14A board.

    Here it is all put together. <br></br>
