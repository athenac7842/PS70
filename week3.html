        This week I was inspired by two machines I saw: four "fingers" tapping metal plates like a piano and 
        a project by Rob of a doll hand hitting a steel sheet. I wanted to make a kinetic sculpture that could be controller
        by a user to move the different materials arranged horizontally along a limited path that will then be struck by
        an instrument spinning attached to a motor. This would create different sounds ideally.

        I used translucent acrylic to make the box so that the inside can be seen for optimal control.

        The dc motor is placed on a platform, and then extends to a hitting instrument.

        The hitting instrument was attached to a gear, which then attaches to a battery via rubber tubbing. This allows for easy assembly and changing of motors if needed.
        A thin metal rod attaches the gear to a 1 cm-thick piece of green plastic for more surface area. This was attached with hot glue.

        I sawed off a 25 cm piece of wooden rod, and created a cardboard holder. The ends of the wooden stick have rubber tubing to limit the range of motion and
        prevent unnecessary movement that could take the machine apart.
        <br></br>
        Two steel plates (one with cardboard attached to the back) and a cardboard piece are glued along the rod to provide a range of sounds (medium, low, high respectively). 
        They were attached with a combination of hot glue and thin metal wire. Due to limited time, scott tape was also used to provide a bit more stability and avoid detachment / rotational movement.

        The end goal was to make a musical kinetic sculpture.
