    <p>
        This is my final project for PS70. The name has the beginning of "robot" and sounds like Robby while also having one of our instructor's name, Rob. 
        <br></br> Rob-B is a 4 legged walking robot with two LED eyes and can detect obstacles using an ultrasonic sensor.

        To make the legs, I used a hanger, and cut it up like so. I also use the part under the hook to make a spacer to separate the "hips" from the "shoulders".

        The body consists of 5 servos. The legs attach to the servo horns (be sure to screw them into the servos before walking or they the legs will fall off). The servos should have the exposed gear facing outward, and the shaft is a servo perpendicular to the front 
        two servos so that it rotates the back two servos once connected. Like so:

    <br></br>
    <p> This is how the hips and shoulders look apart. For the hips, I had to use something to create a separation between the two servos to match the shoulder. Since I am limited
        on supplies, I rolled up tape really tightly and hot glued the back to keep it stable.

        An ultrasound sensor has four pins. From left to right, they should be connected to power (5v), a digital pin, a different digital pin, and ground. This can be seen in the circuit below.
        <br></br>
        Since I am using an Itsybitsy microcontroller, I connected the power to USB to supply the 5 volts. Does not work with the 3v3 pin.

        The code used for detecting objefcts using ultrasound (set to write a value 215 or higher when does not detect within the range):

        Now that I have a plan and a conveniniently sized box, I would begin soldering wires to my prototype boards!
