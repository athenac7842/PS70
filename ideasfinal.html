    Ideas for final project: 
    <br></br>
    1) A silicone material covered in fur that has a heartbeat. I just think this sounds cool, but it would use an arduino to be turned on and off and be given a timing mechanism.
    <br></br> 
    2) maybe something with neuroscience use. I am considering a machine that can detect an aspect of the environment and act on it, or name it, or respond.
    <br></br> 
    3)
